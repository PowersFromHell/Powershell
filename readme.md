Welcome to my collection of PowerShell scripts, hosted here on GitHub. I’m the author of Hadberg.eu, a platform where I share my insights and solutions to make system administration and automation easier. This repository is a collection of scripts I've developed to streamline everyday tasks, optimize workflows, and solve complex problems in IT operations.

On Hadberg.eu, my goal is to share useful tools and resources that empower both system administrators and developers. From basic automation tasks to more sophisticated management solutions, my PowerShell scripts are designed to be simple, practical, and customizable to fit a wide range of environments.

In this repository, you'll find scripts focused on:
* Automation of system administration tasks
* Monitoring and reporting solutions
* Simplifying repetitive processes
* Enhancing productivity with PowerShell

Feel free to explore the scripts, contribute, or suggest improvements. If you have any questions or ideas, don’t hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
