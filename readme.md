Welcome to My PowerShell Script Repository
Welcome to my collection of PowerShell scripts! As the owner and writer behind hadberg.eu, I create and share a variety of solutions designed to help with system administration, automation, and task management using PowerShell. This repository serves as a central place to access and collaborate on the scripts I develop to improve workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance productivity for system administrators and developers alike.

Here, youâ€™ll find scripts for various purposes, from simple one-liners to more complex automation tasks. Each script is designed to be easy to understand, modify, and integrate into your own projects.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt these scripts to suit your needs. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
